Contargo Business Domain
========================

This is a small project aimed at defining the Contargo and COLA business
domain, in a structured way. The goal is to provide a business language
(primarily to use for writing/speaking) in a format that is both
familiar and useful to Java developers. 

## This is not...

* A central implementation of any kind of functionality
* Common utilities library
* Collection of re-usable objects or classes

## This might be used for...

* Tagging local Java solutions, to create correlation between projects
* Referencing actual Java-types and documentation

And more. It's up to you, so join in on the fun!
